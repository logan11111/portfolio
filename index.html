        <h3>Scotts Outdoor Creations - Online website</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In this project, I created a website that allows easy tracking of online orders for a small home buisness. I used a combination of html, css, and javascript to accomplish my goals. 
          One challenge I ran into included using the swiper.js library to make the pages more dynamic which took some research into how the library operated. Submitting Forms and sending emails to orders placed was another big hurdle to overcome as there are many ways to do so but there also limiting factors to consider. 
          Formspree was my final choice for this matter as it worked seamlessly with the current setup. Like most software, this project is still evolving according to the clients needs.

        <h3>Food Upcycling - Restore one's Dignity</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In this project, I collaborated with a volunteer-based organization in Edmonton to design and develop an application that streamlined several of their operational workflows. The app was built with multiple user roles in mind — including admins, volunteers, donors, and beneficiaries — making it one of the more complex systems I’ve worked on. My team and I were proud to deliver a solution that met the organization’s diverse needs and made a meaningful impact.</p>

        <h3>Binary Bandits project</h3>
        <br>
        <p>This project marked my first experience collaborating with a team on a large-scale development. We built an interactive app that gamifies QR code scanning — users earn points each time they scan a code. The app also features a leaderboard for friendly competition and allows users to generate unique profile icons. My team and I were incredibly proud of how functional, responsive, and polished the final product turned out.
