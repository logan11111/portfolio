        <h3>Food Upcycling - Restore one's Dignity</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In this project, I collaborated with a volunteer-based organization in Edmonton to design and develop an application that streamlined several of their operational workflows. The app was built with multiple user roles in mind — including admins, volunteers, donors, and beneficiaries — making it one of the more complex systems I’ve worked on. My team and I were proud to deliver a solution that met the organization’s diverse needs and made a meaningful impact.</p>

        <h3>Binary Bandits project</h3>
        <br>
        <p>This project marked my first experience collaborating with a team on a large-scale development. We built an interactive app that gamifies QR code scanning — users earn points each time they scan a code. The app also features a leaderboard for friendly competition and allows users to generate unique profile icons. My team and I were incredibly proud of how functional, responsive, and polished the final product turned out.
